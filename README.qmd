## Overview

`LogoClim` is a NetLogo model designed to simulate and visualize climate conditions, serving as a powerful tool for exploring both historical and projected climate data. Its primary goal is to facilitate the integration of climate data into agent-based models and enhance the reproducibility of these simulations.

The model utilizes raster data to represent climate variables such as temperature and precipitation over time. It incorporates historical data (1960-2021) and future climate projections (2021-2100) derived from global climate models under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ([SSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways), O’Neill et al. ([2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.01.004))).

The climate data used in `LogoClim` is sourced from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/), which provides high-resolution interpolated climate data based on weather station records from around the world ([Fick & Hijmans, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.5086)). With resolutions as fine as ~1 km², the data is available at multiple spatial scales, ensuring a detailed and comprehensive representation of climate variables.

## How It Works

`LogoClim` operates on a grid of patches, where each patch represents a geographical area and stores values for selected climate variables. During the simulation, patches update their colors based on the data values. The results are visualized on a map, accompanied by plots that display the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of the selected variable over time.

### Color Scale

The model uses a color scale ranging from black (representing the lowest value) to white (representing the highest value). Users can adjust the thresholds for these colors using the **`black-value`** and **`white-value`** sliders. Alternatively, users can set the black or white color to automatically represent the minimum or maximum value of the current data by toggling the **`black-min`** and **`white-max`** switches. By default, the black threshold is set to 0, and the white threshold corresponds to the maximum value of the current data.

### Data Series

The model can simulate the three climate data series provided by [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/):

#### Historical Climate Data

This series includes 12 monthly data points representing average climate conditions for the period 1970–2000. It provides averages on minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, vapor pressure, elevation, and on bioclimatic variables.

Learn more [here](https://www.worldclim.org/data/cmip6/cmip6climate.html).

#### Historical Monthly Weather Data

This series includes 12 monthly data points for each year from 1960 to 2018, based on downscaled data from [CRU-TS-4.06](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.06/), developed by the [Climatic Research Unit](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/climatic-research-unit) at the [University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/). It provides monthly averages for minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and total precipitation..

Learn more [here](https://www.worldclim.org/data/monthlywth.html).

#### Future Climate Data

This series includes 12 monthly data points from downscaled climate projections derived from [CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) models for four future periods: 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100. The projections cover four [SSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways): 126, 245, 370, and 585, with data available for average minimum temperature, average maximum temperature, total precipitation, and bioclimatic variables.

## How to Use It

### Setup

To get started, ensure you have [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo) installed. This model was developed using NetLogo 6.4, so it's recommended to use this version or later. You can download it [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).

The model relies on the GIS ([`gis`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/gis.html)), pathdir ([`pathdir`](https://github.com/cstaelin/Pathdir-Extension)), SimpleR ([`sr`](https://github.com/NetLogo/SimpleR-Extension)), and string ([`string`](https://github.com/NetLogo/String-Extension)) NetLogo extensions, which will be installed automatically when you run the model.

You'll also need [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 4.5 or later) with the [`lubridate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lubridate), [`rJava`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJava), and [`stringr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringr) packages. Make sure the R executable is added to your system's [`PATH`](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html) environment variable. To install the required R packages, run the following command in your R console:

```r
install.packages(c("rJava", "stringr", "lubridate"))
```

### Downloading the Model

You can download the latest release of the model from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/danielvartan/logoclim/releases/latest). To access the development version, clone or download this repository.

### Downloading the Data

`LogoClim` uses raster data to represent climate variables. While you can download the original datasets directly from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/), they must first be converted to ASCII format before being used in NetLogo—Keep the original file names. To simplify this process, we recommend using the preprocessed dataset included in the project's [OSF](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RE95Z) repository.

The datasets are organized using [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) three-letter country codes and are available in multiple spatial resolutions:

- 10 minutes (~340 km² at the equator)
- 5 minutes (~85 km² at the equator)
- 2.5 minutes (~21 km² at the equator)
- 30 seconds (~1 km² at the equator)

After downloading, extract the files into the `data` folder within the model's directory.

We suggest starting with the 10-minute resolution to verify that the model runs smoothly on your system before trying higher resolutions.

These datasets can be reproduced by running the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) notebooks located in the `qmd` folder. To create other datasets, simply modify the notebooks to suit your requirements.

### Running the Model

Once everything is set, open the `logoclim.nlogo` file located in the `nlogo` folder to start exploring!

Refer to the `Info` tab in the model for additional details.

### Integrating with Other Models

`LogoClim` can be integrated with other models using the LevelSpace ([`ls`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/ls.html)) NetLogo extension. This extension enables parallel execution and data exchange between models, making it particularly valuable for agent-based simulations that incorporate climate data to study ecological or environmental processes.

## Common Issues

Some users have reported errors related to the SimpleR ([`sr`](https://github.com/NetLogo/SimpleR-Extension)) extension for NetLogo. These issues are most commonly caused by directory permission problems where the model is stored, the absence of the [`rJava`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJava) R package, or R not being included in the system’s [`PATH`](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html) environment variable. Please ensure all of these are properly configured before opening an issue.

In some cases, users may encounter an unknown error code when running the model for the first time. This may be related to your operating system. Typically, this issue is resolved by trying to setup the model again.

We are actively working to improve the user experience and make the installation process more straightforward.
